> What do the users do at the pickup station?

Before pick-ups are entered into karrot, someone in the foodsaving group has to make a cooperation with the store (or supermarket). We provide guidelines for this [in our wiki](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSINT/pages/46203075/How+to+build+and+maintain+cooperations+with+stores).
Usually the agreement is that pick-ups happen regularly. When a user goes there, they usually get a package of leftover food or get pointed to food that needs to be sorted. They can take the good stuff with them and throw the rest away. Afterwards, they distribute the food in their community.

> Are the tasks in the [Current discussion milestone](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/milestone/9) are the ones that are open to contributions from RGSoC candidates?

There are many tasks to work on; I listed some in the [RGSoC project description](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects/207-karrot-foodsaving-worldwide). Until RGSoC starts in July, new ones will have arrived, and maybe some of them will already be implemented.

RGSoC applications are welcome to contribute to karrot anytime, also before July. Some good issues are the "starter tasks": https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Astarter-task

> Can you please elaborate about the most critical features needed by the community?

All of [our issues](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues) are wishes by the community. I picked the ones that I found most important and feasible during RGSoC and listed them in the [project description](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects/207-karrot-foodsaving-worldwide).

Actually, the most critical points are listed in the [current development](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/milestone/13) milestone, but they are usually not the best candidates for starter tasks because of high complexity.
