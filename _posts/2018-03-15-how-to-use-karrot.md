A lot has changed since we posted [our walkthrough](/2017/05/11/walkthrough.html), so it is time for an update!

First of all: This guide mainly focuses on the desktop version of Karrot. The mobile version looks slightly different, but comes with all features mentioned here.

## Group list, group map and signup

We don't have a landing page anymore. When you access karrot.world nowadays, you will directly see the group list page with the group overview map.

_On the left you can scroll through the groups or directly address them via the search bar._

By clicking on the info button you can view the public information of each group. Some are protected by password, some are not. To join one, however, you first need to create an account. To do so, click on the green button saying 'SIGN UP!' in the upper right corner of your screen.

_This is where you create an account._

After completing the signup you will be redirected to the group list, where you now can join a group. Furthermore, you will receive an email, which asks you to verify your email address. If you decide not to verify your email address, we won't be able to send notification mails to you.

## Playground

If you first want to accustom yourself to the software and simply click around a bit, then the group 'Playground' is where you should go!

## Group wall

The first page you see when joining a group is the group wall.

_The wall of the playground group._

On the group wall people can post messages. Every message triggers a notification mail to the other group members. They then can reply to that mail which will lead to a new message on the wall - pretty cool, huh? ^^ The notification mails can be disabled for you, if you click the round green bell on the upper right corner of the group wall. If you did not verify your email address you will see a red warning sign instead and won't be receiving any emails anyways.

Wall messages support [markdown formatting](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and [emoji](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) - just try it out and you'll see! :)

## Your profile

When clicking on your user name on the top right, you will go to your personal profile page. It should look like this:

![Empty profile](/images/howto/emptyProfile_en.jpg)
_Not much information on there yet..._

Now you may want to add some content on here. Keep in mind that your profile is not relative to the group you're in, which means, that your playground profile is the same as your profile in every other group you enter. If you change it in one place it changes everywhere.
