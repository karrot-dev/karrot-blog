Another recent change is the store multiview, which you probably have noticed already. To improve the general overview, @d0npiano put the store list on the side of the group view, as well as the store detail.

This way the user can always see the overview map of the group, where all the stores are displayed, while still seeing the more detailed map and the description of the currently store, which is currently selected, or the group details and all the upcoming pick-ups, depending on the location.

So basically the store list is now visible on every page relevant to a group, isn't that great? ;)
