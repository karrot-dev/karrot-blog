As you may have noticed the name of our precious foodsaving tool has changed to _Karrot_. We thought it was the right time to give it a real name. The software itself should be easier to recognize and have more of an identity in itself. [Foodsaving.world](https://foodsaving.world) is just a domain, an instance of _Karrot_, but in the future we hope to see many different instances of _Karrot_ run all over the world. There's no need to have one centralized page for all the diverse foodsaving groups out there - they can simply host _Karrot_ themselves and get going!
Also, we hope that a more distinct name for the software would decrease confusion about names, because all the terms starting with 'food' already were quite puzzling for some...
