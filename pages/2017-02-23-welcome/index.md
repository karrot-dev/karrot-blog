A lot is happening on the foodsaving tool pages lately! New features are manifold
and motivation is high, as new and old contributors put in unparalleled amounts
of time and energy to make this tool and page nice and useful for everybody.

The most obvious new feature maybe is this blog...^^ A team page also is about
to come, to make it more transparent who are the people working behind this
project; stay tuned for (hopefully) nice pictures and personal revelations! ;)

You can visit the latest released version at
[foodsaving.world](https://foodsaving.world)
or the bleeding edge development version at
[dev.foodsaving.world](https://dev.foodsaving.world).
